Gridulous is intended to be a flexible, extendable grid plugin. There are a few things that I intended this plugin to provide--things I was unable to find in existing plugins:

1. The ability to extract, modify and store configuration of the grid. All changes to the state of the grid are pushed into the configuration before taking any action. That way the configuration is a valid snapshot of the state of the grid at any moment in time.
2. The ability to customize the search dialog for your specific needs. This includes customizing the search filters that you want Gridulous to pass to your service action.
3. Clear exposure of the styling of the grid so that the visual can be customized.
4. Tight jQuery integration so that the grid can be easily hacked apart as needed for your special needs.
5. An object oriented approach to the organization of the code. This is intended to be an aid to navigating the source and making changes you might desire.

At this time, this project is nowhere near ready for primetime but you are more than welcome to grab it and poke around at it.

Installation:

Other plugins you will need:
1. jQuery                    (http://jquery.com)
2. jQuery-UI                 (http://jqyueryui.com
3. Classy                    (http://classy.pocoo.org)
4. SASS                      (http://sass-lang.com)

The checked in version is on top of a simple Ruby on Rails project but with the four above tools you can use it anywhere you want. The RoR part uses a mostly standard set up. The big difference is that I prefer HAML to ERB.

Once you have those things installed you can grab the contents of these directories and put them where you wish:

public/stylesheets/gridulous/
public/stylesheets/gridulous/sass/
public/stylesheets/images/
public/javascripts/gridulous/

Please note that the images that begin with "ui-" are jQuery-UI images and should be replaced with whatever custom theme you roll. The other images are temporary images that I'll be replacing shortly. I've just been using them in my development environment--I borrowed them from flexigrid (http://flexigrid.info)--the grid plugin that really has set the standard in my opinion.

Eventually I'll package these things up in a zip file but for now, take it at your own risk. I'll gladly answer any questions to help you get things going though...

For a working example of how to configure Gridulous, see people-table.js in public/javascripts. Once you have your own configuration built up, take a quick peek at app/views/people/index.html.haml to see what you have to add to the file to get it working. It's not painful.

Forgive the completely chaotic project--I'm still getting it up and running.
